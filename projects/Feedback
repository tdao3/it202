Round 1

- The first implementation, the to do list consisted of a due date and time, but
the user thought that it would be redundant to have both to do and reminders
if they end up doing the same thing. So I changed the to do list into something
that is similar to a posit it note, where it is something that you have to do
, but has no specific due date to it.

- The events cards at the beginning were all one color and displayed only todays
events. The user thought that it would nice to display two days worth of events
or more based on settings instead of just displaying the events for the day.
Just in case that day you have nothing going on or you would like to check
what you need to attend "tomorrow"

- For the reminders originally there was a strict dude date and time, meaning
only the specific day can be displayed under the "Date" column. The user thought
that this works as intended since reminders are usually set for a specific day
and time to alarm or make sound.

- The About me was originally placed as an extra tab, but the user said it was 
a bit unecessary to give a whole page to just the about me page.

Round 2

- I decided to give the user an option to not include a date and time under the
to do list so that it can be arbitrary. The user thought this was a good choice 
since it can give users more freedom using the to do list

- The event card colors were changed from just being all the same color to 
becoming a gradient. So the closer the event is to the current day, the brighter
the event card will be. The events that are further away from the current day
get a darker version of the colored card.

- I kept the reminders the same since the user was satisfied with that option

- For the about me I ended up putting it inside the "menu" bars so when the user
clicks it, the bar will display the information about the developer on there.
